<p></p> To run this frontend Vue app which utilizes the Laravel backend I created, install Vue.js, NPM, and run these commands within the project directory.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

Axios installation may be required (however the dependencies are in the .json package files in this project). If necessary, run:
```
npm i axios
```

### To run the app on your localhost at "localhost:8080":
```
npm run serve
```

Make sure your local web server is running, and you have performed all of the necessary steps for running the Laravel side of the project first.
<br><br>
It's a simple app that has full GET, POST, PUT and DELETE functionality with a MySQL database using Laravel 10. Users can click and drag items to rearrange their priority, then click a submit button to save those priority changes to the database. Tasks can also be updated and deleted, and the database is queried on page load.

See "AppUI.jpg" for a screenshot of the app, located in the "screenshots" folder.
